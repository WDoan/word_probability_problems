A representative from the National Football League's Marketing Division randomly selects people on a random street in Kansas City, Kansas until he finds a person who attended the last home football game. Let p, the probability that he succeeds in finding such a person, equal 0.20. And, let X denote the number of people he selects until he finds his first success. What is the probability that the marketing representative must select more than 6 people before he finds one who attended the last home football game?
