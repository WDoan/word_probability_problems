As an alternative to 10 homework problems, your teacher proposes that you play the Birthday Game. You need to guess the day of the week that one of her friends were born. If you guess correctly, you only have one homework problem. If not, you must guess the birthday of another friend. The game continues until you guess correct and the number of guesses equals the number of homework problems. What is the probability that you have one homework problem?
