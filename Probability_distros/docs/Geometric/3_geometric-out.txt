A representative from the National Football League's Marketing Division randomly selects people on a random street in Kansas City, Kansas until he finds a person who attended the last home football game. Let p, the probability that he succeeds in finding such a person, equal 0.20. And, let X denote the number of people he selects until he finds his first success. How many people should we expect (that is, what is the average number) the marketing representative needs to select before he finds one who attended the last home football game?
