In a test for ESP (extrasensory perception), a subject is told that cards the experimenter can see but the subject cannot contain a star, a circle, a wave, or a square. As the experimenter looks at each card in turn, the subject names the shape on the card. A subject who is just guessing has probability 0.25 of guessing correctly on each card. What is the probability of the subject obtaining his/her first correct guess within the first 4 questions?
