A venture capitalist invests in start-up companies in Silicon Valley, California. Each start-up company either succeeds or fails. If a company fails the venture capitalist loses $3 million dollars; if the company succeeds the capitalist gains $8 million dollars. What is the probability that the investor will fail with the first 11 companies and succeed for the first time on his/her 12th investment? What assumption do you have to make to determine this probability?
