A manufacturer of electronics components produces precision resistors designed to have a tolerance of Â±1%. From quality-control testing, the manufacturer knows that about one resistor in six is actually within just 0.3% of its nominal value. A customer needs two of these more precise resistors. What is the probability of finding exactly two such resistors among the first four tested?
