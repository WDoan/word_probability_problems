A manufacturer of TV sets wants to advertise that if a TV manufactured by the company lasts for less than a certain number of years, the company will refund the full amount paid for the set. The company wants to pick the number of years for the advertisement in such a way that it will not have to give refunds on more than 4% of the sets. If the life of a TV set is normally distributed with a mean life of 8.5 years and a standard deviation of 1.8 years, provide the number of years for the companyâ€™s advertisement.
