On the average, a student takes 100 words per minute midway through an advanced court reporting course at the American Institute of Court Reporting.  Assuming that the dictation speeds of the students are normally distributed and that the standard deviation is 20 words per minute, find the probability that a student can take dictation at a speed of:(a)  more than 125 words per minute.(b)  between 75 and 100 words per minute.(c)  less than 70 words per minute.
