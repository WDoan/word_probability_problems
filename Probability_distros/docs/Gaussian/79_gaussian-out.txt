Cylindrical metal bolts are manufactured to fit inside close-fitting metal collars. Ifthe diameter of a bolt has a normal distribution with mean 15mm and standarddeviation 0.3mm and the internal diameter of the collar has a normal distributionwith mean 16mm and standard deviation 0.3mm, independently of the bolt, find theprobability that the bolt will be too big to fit inside the collar.
