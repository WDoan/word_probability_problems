Suppose it is known that the annual income X of the US-population is normally distributed with mean m = $37,000.00 and standard deviation s = $13,000.00. (My data is not real data). A) The annual income of a professor is $64,000 and his GTA's annual income is $12,000.00. How many standard deviation apart are the income of the professor and the GTA?B) The Chairman's annual income is $77,000.00. How many standard deviation apart are the income of the professor and the Chair?
