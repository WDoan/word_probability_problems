Suppose you are in charge of student ticket sales for a college football team. From past experience, you know that the number of tickets purchased by a student standing in line at the ticket window has a distribution with mean 2.4 and standard deviation 2.0. For today's game, there are 100 students standing in line to purchase tickets. If only 250 tickets remain, what is the probability that all 100 students will be able to purchase the tickets they desire? (Hint: 250 tickets for 100 students would be how many on average for each student?)
