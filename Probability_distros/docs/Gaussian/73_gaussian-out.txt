Suppose that a binary message -either 0 or 1- must be trasmitted by wire from location A to location B.However, the data sent over the wire are subject to a channel noise disturbance, so to reduce the possibiltyof error, the value 2 is sent over the wire when the message is 1 and the value -2 is sent when the messageis 0. If x, x=±2, is the value sent from location A, then R, the value received at location B, is given byR=x+N, where N is the channel noise disturbance. When the message is received at location B thereceiver decodes it according to the following rule:If R≥0.5, then 1 is concludedIf R<0.5, then 0 is concludedIf the channel noise follows the standard normal distribution compute the probability that the message willbe wrong when decoded.
