Suppose a variety of bananas produces bunches that have a mean weight of 70 pounds with a standard deviation of 3 pounds. (Please draw a picture showing what you are looking for.)a) What is the probability that a bunch will weigh between 70 and 74 pounds?P(70<x<74)=b) What is the probability that a bunch chosen at random will weigh between 71 and 75 pounds?P(71<x<75)=c) What is the probability that a bunch will weigh between 68 and 76 pounds?P(68<x<76)=d) What is the probability that a bunch will weigh less than 63 pounds?P(x<63)=e) How small must a bunch be to be in the smallest 12% of bunches?
