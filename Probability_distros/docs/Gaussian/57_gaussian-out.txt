Suppose a large orchard produces apples that have a mean weight of 112 grams with a standard deviation of 8 grams. (Please draw a picture showing what you are looking for.)a) What percentage of apples will weigh less than 120 grams?P(x<120)b) What percentage of apples will weigh between 112 and 120 grams?P(112<x<120)=c) What is the probability that an apple chosen at random will weigh between 120 and 132 grams?P(120<x<132)=d) What percentage will weigh between 100 and 120 grams?P(100<x<120)=e) How small must an apple be to be in the smallest 10% of apples?f) What range of apple sizes will make up the middle 50% of the population?
