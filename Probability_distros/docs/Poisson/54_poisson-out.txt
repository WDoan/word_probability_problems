Two taxi arrive on average at a certain street corner for every 15 minutes. Suppose that the number of taxi arriving at this street corner follows a Poisson distribution. Three people are waiting at the street corner for taxi (assuming they do not know each other and each one will have his own taxi). Each person will be late for work if he does not catch a taxi within the next 15 minutes. What is the probability that all three people will make it to work on time?
