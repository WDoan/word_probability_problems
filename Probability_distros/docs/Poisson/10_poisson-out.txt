Security cameras in the Bullion Bank of Nevada have established that, during the last half-hour of business on Friday, an average of 3 customers enter its lobby to deposit their bulk gold. Gold is heavy, and the bank does not want to keep its gold-bearing customers waiting. How many tellers should it have on duty so that the chance that a customer will be kept waiting for a teller is less than 10%?
