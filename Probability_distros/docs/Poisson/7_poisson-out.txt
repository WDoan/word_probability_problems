It is tent inspection time on the Provo Proving Ground, and any irregularities will be cause for extra KP duty. The tent manufacturer's established track record is 1 weaving fault per 50 square feet of canvas. If Barney's tent contains 75 square feet of canvas, and he is otherwise an immaculate tentkeeper, what are his chances of pulling extra KP?
