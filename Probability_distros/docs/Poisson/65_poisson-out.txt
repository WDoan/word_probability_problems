In an article published in 1996 in the New England Journal of Medicine (Leor, J., Poole,w. K., and Kloner, R. A. Sudden cardiac death triggered by a earthquake, Vol. 334(7)1996 , 413-419) researchers studied the incidence of cardiac death before and on the dayof an earthquake in Los Angeles County on January 17, 1994. In the week before theearthquake there were an average of 15.6 cardiac deaths per day. On the day of theearthquake, there were 51 cardiac deaths.a) Assuming that the number of cardiac deaths follows a Poisson distribution with lambda=15.6 per day, what is the probability of 51 or more cardiac deaths in a day? b) What is the maximum number of cardiac deaths that could have occurred on the day ofthe earthquake that would have been consistent with the rate of cardiac deaths in the pastweek?
