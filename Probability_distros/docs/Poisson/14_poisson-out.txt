Filomena the entrepreneur packages frog legs in small jars for upscale diners, at $100 a jar. She sells them thorough the local supermarket, Filbert's Finer Feedables, where very few people have a taste for exotic cuisine, but on the other hand, very many people turn up in the course of a week. Filbert the manager normally sells 5 jars of frog legs a week. He now says that he will accept no more than 5 new jars each Monday. Filomena argues that he does not want to send even a few of his discerning customers away disappointed, so he should stock enough jars to provide against this possibility. They agree that Filbert will buy just enough jars that there is only a 10% chance that he will sell them all before Saturday night. They cannot figure out how many jars this should be. They turn to you to arbitrate. How many jars should Filbert buy each week from Filomena?
