Traffic accidents occur along a 50-mile stretch of highway at the rate of 0.85 during the hour from 5 PM to 6 PM. Suppose that the number of traffic accidents in this stretch of highway follows a Poisson distribution. The department of transportation plans to observe the traffic flow in this stretch of highway during this hour in a two-day period. What is the probability that more than three accidents occur in this observation period?
